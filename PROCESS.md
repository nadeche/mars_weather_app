### Mars Weather Explorer
## Day 2| 31-05-2016
Yesterday I found out there is already an app in the Google play store named Mars Weather App. So today I decided to give this project the name "Mars Weather Explorer". I think this also covers the concept of this app a bit better because it tries to emphasize a bit on the feeling of exploring a new place.

The news on the [NASA Curiosity site](http://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission/mars-rover-curiosity-mission-updates/) has more interesting content than the twitter news feed. However there is no API to collect these news articles. To bring these stories in the app the site will have to be screped.There is an open java libary to do this, but I am unsure if it can be implemented within an android app. So when all other features are implemented if there is enough time I can try to implement this. However if there is not enough time the twitter feed will be just fine.
## Day 3| 01-06-2016
I spend a lot of time making the UML diagram. I chose to save the user settings in an instance of SharedPreferences. This seems like a simple way to store primitive data types. Working on the UI I decided to move the option to ask the user from till when they want to see weather data to the action bar. This seems more consequent design wise withe the rest op the app.
## Day 4| 02-06-2016
Today I spend moost of my time figuring out how to get the swipeviews working. I had a big bug trying to implement the material theme. I choose to have my app work from android version 21 specialy so I could use that, but everything was setup by android studio using AppCompat again. It is frustrating that Goolge wants to promote using material design, but they make it dam hard. So now again I am stuck with AppCompat, when I have time I will try to make it work with Theme.Material.
## Day 5| 03-06-2016
Today I worked on the layout. I still have a feew bugs in the layout of the weather data screen. I still have to search how to dysplay all data on top of the image, right now it doesn't look very nice and it doesn't fit in sceen.
## Day 6| 04-06-2016
Today I figured out the bugs with the layout. The imageView had to be set to adjustToImageViewBounds: true. And bauces of the coordinator layout I have to set all views within a linear layout to prevent the layout extending behind the navigation bar. I am thinking about how to work with teh action bar and different icons on the different screens. Because not all options are avalible with every screen.
## Day 7| 06-06-2016
I am thinking about changes to the UI. Particularly the setting for temperature unit. To change it to maybe a FAB or an icon in the action bar that works as a sitch. So tab means change the the other unit and change the icon. It seems a bit redundent to have a seperate dialog for such a simpe single setting.
## Day 8| 07-06-2016
Today I have been strugeling with the context of the fragments and the context of the activity. The problem I had was the call to the AcyncTask. Yesterday I organised that AcyncTask works with the fragment context. Today I tryed to implement the search for a perticular date, but this was called through the actionbar in the activity. In the end I fixed it by moving the specific fragment related icons to the fragment itself. This also means that I fixed the change of the actionbar icons when changing fragmet.
I stated woring on the function to download a rover photo. I decided to just pick the first photo that comes back, since the photo's don't differ much. Now I have to decide how the setup the dialog to make the download request. It needs to contain a list of camera's and a number picker for the solar date. Not sure if Im'going to use a list with a radio button or a onItemClickListener that automaticly brings the number from the number picker.
## Day 9| 08-06-2016
Today I decided to implement a spinner dropdown to let the user choose a camera. This seens like the most userfrendly solution because the dialog doesn't get so messy. I still have to think about how to position the downloaded photos. Some are smaller in with than the screen and some are so big the photo extends behind the weather data. What gives the user a nice view of the photo without compromizing the view of the weather data or an empty screen because to photo is so smal?
## Day 10| 09-06-2016
Today I decided to switch the libary I use to make a graph from Graph View to [MPAndroidChart](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart). After concideration this liberay provides a graph more in the layout I have in mind. Also the rerender function it offers seems to work quite efficient, which I need in order to let the user choose from when till when they want to see data from. This library also works for IOS so if I want to continue with this project and extent it to IOS there should be no problem.
