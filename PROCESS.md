## Mars Weather Explorer
# Day 2
Yesterday I found out there is already an app in the Google play store named Mars Weather App. So today I decided to give this project the name "Mars Weather Explorer". I think this also covers the concept of this app a bit better because it tries to emphasize a bit on the feeling of exploring a new place.
